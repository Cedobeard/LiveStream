# LiveStream
Scripts to help with live-streaming games and stuff.

TransparentChromeOnTop.ahk uses AutoHotKey to run the code.
  You can google AutoHotKey and find their website, then get the ZIP versions.
  Once unzipped, I drag and drop my script file (really just a .txt file) onto the AutoHotkeyU64.exe file to run it.
  It's currently written so that OBS must be running in order to enact any functionality at all.
  But you can undo the functionality regardless, if the script is active.
  To cause Chrome (and therefore your chat feed) to become "alwaysOnTop" and transparent, press CTRL+SHIFT+1.
  To undo the transparence and alwaysOnTop, press CTRL+SHIFT+2.
  You can find the script running in your system tray (Windows) and right click to see the exit option.
  To edit the script so the OBS requirement is gone:
    Open the script with notepad.exe, and delete the two "IfWinExist" lines. Save, then drag the script on the .exe again.
    
I'm excited this seems to work. Please message me for requests, but no promises.
Send email to humanpriori@gmail.com with the word "github" somewhere in the message.
Thanks,
